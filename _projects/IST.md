### Course description

#### Overview

The Bachelor programme in Aerospace Engineering is a synthesis of advanced technologies that distinguish the 20th century from those that preceded it, which are of increasing importance in the 21st century; they are integrated in various types of vehicles, such as airplanes, helicopters, robotic aircraft, rockets and satellites and in associated support means such as air traffic management and other operational aspects.

All these vehicles integrate dynamics of atmospheric, orbital and interplanetary flight, and a wide range of modern technologies, which include aerodynamics, propulsion, structures, materials, manufacturing processes, control, computing, electronics, telecommunications, artificial intelligence, electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic and other systems.

#### History

The Bachelor's Degree in Aerospace Engineering was established in 1991 through the Integrated Master's Degree in Aerospace Engineering, with an initial numerus clausus of 35, which gradually increased to the current 135 with a consistently growing intake. The minimum entry grade has always been the highest among all engineering programs in Portugal and recently became the highest among all university courses. The Aerospace Engineering program is dedicated to maximizing the potential of all its students.

#### Objectives

At the end of the Degree in Aerospace Engineering, the student should have developed knowledge and skills to:

- To conceive, design, manufacture, and operate systems and products using creativity, critical thinking, autonomy, and an interdisciplinary approach.

- To solve engineering problems in various contexts, considering technological, economic, social, and environmental constraints.

- To handle complex aerospace engineering problems, even when faced with limited or incomplete information. Be able to make judgments while considering ethical and social implications and responsibilities.

- To navigate and interact on professional situations in diverse industrial organizations, services, research, and cultural and educational settings.

#### Designed for

The Aerospace Engineering program has several attractive features:

- High-quality education aimed at fully developing the potential of students who enter with the highest grades in higher education.

- A wide range of choices in the master's program, covering most of the current areas of advanced technology.

- Access to specialized laboratories, including those focused on aeronautics, as well as computational resources and dedicated projects such as nanosatellites.

- Faculty members actively engaged in high-level research, capable of supervising master's and doctoral theses in various domains.

- Opportunities for dual degrees and Erasmus exchanges with some of the best universities in Europe and beyond.

- Excellent job prospects both in Portugal and abroad in the aerospace, space, consulting, and other sectors.
