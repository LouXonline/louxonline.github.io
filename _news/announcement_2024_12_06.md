Welcome to my website! There are still a lot of things to be put in place. This local host stuff took some time to get used to and there are still a few things I think are not working the way they are supposed to. This website is being powered by Jekyll with al-folio theme and being hosted by GitHub Pages. Anyway, if you are reading this, you just found a gem!

I will keep trying to improve this as best as I can. The goal is to have a website where I can share my work and, in some way, more personal aspects of my life. I will leave a quote down below:
