  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={Modelling the Earth's magnetic field with magnetometer data from a Raspberry Pi on board the ISS},
  author={Barros e Sá, Nuno and Gouveia Faria, Lourenço and Alves, Bernardo and Cymbron, Miguel},
  abstract={We used data from a magnetometer on board the ISS to simulate the Earth's magnetic field. For that purpose, we generated two models from the data and compared them: an off-centered dipole model and a centered multipolar model. We found out that measuring the magnetic field along only two orbits is not enough to provide a good estimate of the Earth's magnetic field, as they chart a too small portion of the Earth's surface. This was our original work within the "Astro Pi Challenge", a project ran by ESA and the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and the magnetometer used was the one incorporated in the Raspberry Pi Sense Hat. Here, we improved by performing the same analysis using data from ten orbits and learned that the multipolar model already provides a good approximation to the Earth's magnetic field with this number of orbits. We also noticed a deviation of the data collected from what would be expected from the IGRF model, in both sets of data.},

  abstract={The Earth's magnetic field can be decomposed into spherical harmonics, and the exact coefficients of the decomposition can be determined through a few measurements of its value at different locations. Using measurements from a magnetometer on board the International Space Station, we computed the multipolar moments of an expansion in spherical harmonics to order 3, calculated the location of the magnetic dip poles, and produced an intensity map of the magnetic field across the globe. The accuracy of the results was evaluated by comparison with data from the International Geomagnetic Reference Field.},
